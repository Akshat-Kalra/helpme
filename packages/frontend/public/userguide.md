# How to use HelpMe

## General

### What is this system? And what are the major features of it and why should I use it?

This is the HelpMe course help system.

There are 3 main features of the system:
- Queues
- Course Chatbot
- Anytime Question Hub

**Queues**: This is essentially a virtual queue. Some of the use cases where this can be really useful is for online/hybrid office hours/labs, or for really busy in-person labs (where there can be 3+ more students with their hand up at one time). 

Some of the benefits include:
- data collection (so professors know what questions are being asked or what TAs don't check-in or answer questions or what sessions are the busiest)
- fairness (staff can pre-assess and prioritize high-priority questions, staff can see how long students have been waiting and prioritize ones that have been waiting a while, and selfless students can feel more comfortable asking questions without worry that they will take time away from other students)
- students don't need to hold their hand up (for in-person)
- improved organization (especially for virtual/hybrid sessions)

Additionally, for the use case where students have to do demonstrations and have items that need to be checked off (e.g. in a chemistry lab that has multiple parts to the experiment that need to be looked at before they can continue) the professor can set an assignment ID and create tasks, which will allow students to create either a regular question or a demo for what tasks they want checked off.

**Course Chatbot**: Unlike something like ChatGPT, this course chatbot allows professors to upload their course documents (e.g. syllabus, lab files, slides, etc.) which the chatbot can then use and cite when students ask it questions using a sophisticated RAG system. 

Additionally, staff members can see what questions are being asked to gauge student understanding which can help professors improve their courses, which is data that would otherwise be lost if they use something like ChatGPT.

**Anytime Question Hub**: Students can post questions here, get an immediate AI answer, and can then say if they are satisfied or not with their answer, which will send an email notification to all staff signed up for it that there's a new question and can come and answer it. You can think of it like an "email 2.0". It becomes especially useful for classes with large amount of students, notably because unlike email, any TA can answer the student. Initially only the student that created the question and staff can see the question, but if a staff member likes the question enough, they can make it public so that any student can see it (but the student will still remain anonymous). 

Note that professors can turn off any of these major features in the course settings.

### How can I navigate/go to X page? 

- First you should know there are two "levels" of navigation:
  - Organization "level" - Shows all the courses you have access to in this organization
    - If you are a professor, you can create a course from this page
  - Course "level" - This is likely where you are, as this is where most of the features are (including the course chatbot)

If you are on desktop, at the top of the page will be the navbar. On mobile, there is a hamburger menu at the top right of the screen that will show the nav menu.

The navigation elements are as follows:

- Course Page (will show the name of the course in bold e.g. "**COSC 304**"): Usually the first page you are on. You are likely here or on a queue page.
- Queues: Has a dropdown menu that shows all of the queues in the course. 
- Anytime Qs: Takes you to the Anytime Question Hub page
- Schedule
- Course Settings (staff-only)
- Insights (professors-only)
- My Courses: Takes you up a "level" back to the organization level with the "my courses" page
- "Your Name": Appears at the top right of the navbar on desktop. Upon hovering, it will show a dropdown menu that will give you the option to go to the profile settings page or to logout. On mobile, this appears at the bottom of the nav menu and logout is also at the bottom of the nav menu rather than a dropdown.

### What are on all the pages?

- Course Page: On the course page on the left side there is a list of queues with a list of which staff are checked into each queue (a queue with checked-in staff have an animated border). Just below this list of queues there is a card that takes you to the Anytime Question Hub. And just below that is a graph that shows estimated wait times at various times at various times of the week. On the right side of the course page, depending on how the professor customizes it, there will either be a window for the course chatbot or a condensed view of the schedule. If you see the schedule, at the bottom-right of the page there will be a little "Chat Now" button that also opens up the course chatbot. 

## Student FAQ

### How to create a question / join a queue / create a ticket

Note that "question" can mean 3 different things on this system. There are queue questions, chatbot questions, or anytime questions, and they are all very different.

For queue questions:
1. You must be on a queue page with checked-in staff
2. If you are on desktop, there will be a blue button at the top-left that says "Join Queue". If you are on mobile, there will be a big blue button that says "Join Queue" near the top or middle of the page.
3. From there, you will get a popup modal to create the question and can now enter your question's text and any question types. Once done, click "finish"
4. From there, you will see a blue banner which shows all of your current questions, their statuses (e.g. if it's unfinished or currently being helped), and the position of the question in the queue. Just below this blue banner is a list of all questions in the queue, and your question is highlighted green. 
5. Once the staff member starts helping you, either you will go to the staff member or the staff member will come to you (or if it's online/hybrid, you will need to join the Zoom or Teams meeting. You should get a popup modal with a link you can click to do so). 

For chatbot questions:
1. If you are on the course page, there should be a big chatbot window where you can ask chatbot questions. Otherwise, there is a little blue "Chat Now!" button at the bottom-right of the screen on most pages that you can chat with.

For anytime questions:
1. You must be on the Anytime Question Hub page (can click the "Anytime Qs" on the navbar). There, you should see a large blue "Post Question" button that you can click.
2. From there, you can fill out the question abstract (which is just a short summary of what your question is or about, kind of like an email subject line), the question text, and any categories that the question falls under (if the professor has created any question tags).
3. Then, click finish. You will immediately get a response from the course chatbot AI, which you can then say if you are satisfied with that answer or if you still need faculty help. If you click "Still need faculty Help" it will automatically email any professors and TAs (if they have signed up for emails) to come and give you an answer (or modify the response so that it is correct). 

### Help I can't create a question / join a queue / create a ticket

Note that "question" can mean 3 different things on this system. There are queue questions, chatbot questions, or anytime questions, and they are all very different.

For queue questions:
1. Double check that you are in a queue with staff in it
2. You may already have a question either in this queue or another queue. What likely happened is you accidentally closed the "Create Question" popup modal while you were drafting/creating your question. There should be a round pulsating button that you can click/tap to finish creating your question.
3. If it's none of these things, feel free to report it to adam.fipke@ubc.ca

For chatbot questions:
1. This is likely a bug if you can't create a chatbot question, feel free to report it to adam.fipke@ubc.ca

For anytime questions:
1. This is also likely a bug if you can't create an anytime question, feel free to report it to adam.fipke@ubc.ca

### Will other students be able to see my questions?

- For queue questions, no all questions are anonymous for other students. Only TAs and professors can see who asked the question
- Likewise, for the anytime question hub, all anytime questions are also anonymous to other students. Only TAs and professors can see who asked the question. 
  - When you first create an anytime question, only you and staff can see it. Staff then have the option to post the question publicly so that other students can see the question, but don't worry! You will still appear as an anonymous student.

## Staff FAQ

### How do I get started?

1. First, you need permissions. Before you can get permissions, you need to [create an account on HelpMe](https://coursehelp.ubc.ca/login) (if you are coming from UBC, I recommend you login with UBC). You will also need to contact Dr. Ramon Lawrence at ramon.lawrence@ubc.ca that you are interested in using the system and that you have created an account, and he can elevate you to a professor position and possibly help create a course for you. If you need some quicker help regarding HelpMe, you can also contact Adam, who is an active developer of the system, at adam.fipke@ubc.ca
2. Once logged in, you should be on the "My Courses" page. If you already have a course page, great! Click on that. Otherwise, you will need to create a course with the blue "Add New Course" button on the right. From there, you should be able to fill in the fields and click "Add course" (don't forget to add yourself as a professor!)
3. On the course page, you can create queues (the button to do so is located just below the anytime question hub card)
4. 

### How to check-in or check-out of the queue? Why?

Staff must first check-in to a queue before students can create any questions. To check-in, you can click the blue "Check In" button near the top of the course page or click the blue "Check In" button on the left column in the queue page. 

### How can I edit a queue? What are all the options that I can edit for a queue and what do they all do?


### What are the roles of the system?

There are two "levels" of roles in HelpMe.

For organization-level roles, there are:
- User
- Professor
  - Main difference is between this and the User role is Professors can create courses
- Admin
  - Has access to the Organization settings panel

For course-level roles, there are:
- Student
  - Can create queue questions, chatbot questions, and anytime questions, and also modify their profile or see the schedule
- TA
  - Can answer queue questions, verify chatbot questions (under Course Settings page), and give human answers/verify anytime questions.
  - Can check-in and check-out of queues, and edit queue details (and edit the anytime question hub), and manually add students to the queue. 
  - Cannot create queue questions, but can still make chatbot questions or anytime questions (for demonstration or testing purposes)
  - On the course settings page, can create/modify queue invites, edit student's queue questions or chatbot questions, or edit settings of the chatbot
- Professor
  - Same as a TA but with even more permissions
  - Has access to more items on the Course Settings page (e.g. the course roster, the TA check-in check-out times, general course settings (which includes the course name, course-wide zoom link, the course feature toggles, the course invite link, and a button to archive the course))
  - Has access to the Insights page

Colloquially, anyone with a course-level role of TA or Professor is known as a "staff" member (and staff does not mean developer/customer service of the system).

### What is the schedule page? Why is it here?

The schedule page lets you create events. These can be one-time events or recurring events. You can either click and drag on the schedule page to create an event or click the "Add Event" button at the top-right.

The main advantage to creating events is you can assign your staff members to these events, which will cause them to auto-checkout once the event ends (saving you the need to remember to checkout). It is **strongly** recommended to do this at the start of your course.
